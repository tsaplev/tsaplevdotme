            <h2>Hi, Iâ€™m Alex! A software engineer and traveller.</h2>
            <p>My life's journey started on October 18, 1998, when I entered the world in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia â€“ a
                city located five hours east of Moscow. After graduating from high school, I relocated
                to Moscow to pursue a career in tech. While living there, I started exploring different places
                on weekends
                and quickly fell in love with traveling.</p>

            <p>Today, I live in London, United Kingdom and continue to pursue my passions for both travel and work. I'm
                always excited
                to
                discover new destinations, and I enjoy planning each trip myself. Whether it's traveling luxuriously or
                on a tight budget, to popular
                destinations or less touristy ones, I'm always up for an adventure.</p>

            <p>I believe that traveling is an essential part of life that opens up a world of possibilities. Aside from
                traveling, I'm passionate about
                aviation and aspire to
                become a private pilot someday.</p>

            <p>As a software engineer, I'm fortunate to have a flexibility that allows me to balance work and
                travel. <br/> Life is short, and I want to make the most of it by experiencing all the world has to
                offer!</p>
